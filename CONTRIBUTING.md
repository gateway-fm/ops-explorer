# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to Block Explorer.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contribution is licensed under the Apache
License, Version 2.0.

## Developer Certificate of Origin

This project uses the Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1. Sign off each commit
with:

```bash
git commit -s
```

The sign-off certifies that you have the right to submit the contribution under
the project license.

CI enforces this on every pull request (the `DCO` check). Merge commits and bot
commits are exempt. If a commit is missing the sign-off:

```bash
git rebase --signoff origin/main
git push --force-with-lease
```

(Force-push works on fork branches. Branches inside this repository are
force-push-protected — re-create the branch and open a fresh PR instead.)

## Development

Before opening a pull request:

- Keep changes focused and reviewable.
- Add or update tests when changing behavior.
- Do not commit secrets, private audit reports, local agent state, or generated
  credentials.
- Do not report security issues in public pull requests or issues; follow
  SECURITY.md.

Useful checks:

```bash
cd backend && go build ./... && go build -tags privacy ./... && go test ./...
npm --prefix frontend run lint
npm --prefix frontend test
npm --prefix frontend run build
```

Some checks require optional services such as Postgres, Anvil, a running
chain-indexer, or the Open Privacy Suite sibling repository
([gateway-fm/open-privacy-suite](https://github.com/gateway-fm/open-privacy-suite)). The privacy-mode e2e
job in CI is maintainer-gated (manual dispatch + a repository variable) and is
expected to be skipped on public forks.
